Designed the database schema to accommodate medical records, patient information, appointment scheduling, and inventory management.
Implemented features for adding, updating, and retrieving patient records, scheduling appointments, and managing medical inventory.

Tools and Technologies:
Java for application development, using Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
JDBC for database connectivity with MySQL.
MySQL for database management.

Achievements:
Successfully developed a Medical Management System that streamlined medical record management, appointment scheduling, and inventory tracking for healthcare facilities.
